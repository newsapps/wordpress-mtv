Models, Templates and Views for WordPress
=========================================

MTV is a plugin for WordPress that provides a new API for developing plugins and themes. Born out of frustration with the undocumented, inconsistent WordPress API, MTV provides a simple, familiar, consistent way to develop heavily customized WordPress sites.

MTV borrows a lot from existing MVC-style frameworks, namely `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and `Backbone.js <http://http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/>`_. If you're familiar with those frameworks, you should feel at home using MTV. If you're not familiar, go `try <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/>`_ some `tutorials <https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/wiki/Tutorials%2C-blog-posts-and-example-sites>`_. It'll make you a better programmer.

This plugin hijacks and takes over how WordPress handles URLs and templates, and gives you new ORM-style tools for handling posts, users and blogs. This plugin does nothing by itself, and (hopefully) will not break stuff that you already have. It's just a set of tools for developers to use.
